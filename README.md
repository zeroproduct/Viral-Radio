Viral Radio App for our curated radio station
---

A radio streaming station created in iOS curated by *Albert Guillermo* (@svvperb) and I. We wanted to create a hip-hop station that showcased hit tracks, tracks that are on the rise, and song we personally felt would eventually become popular. 
This project was also a great way for us to learn about iOS development, (CentoCast) [http://www.centova.com/en/cast] an audio broadcasting service, and the Twitter API in order to Tweet current songs that were being played to our personal account.
